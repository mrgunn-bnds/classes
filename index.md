### Computer Science for the IB Diploma by Paul Baumgarten, Ioana Ganea, and Carl Turland

<img style="float: right; width: 100px" src="assets/ib-compsci-book.png">
**Computer Science for the IB Diploma** published by Hachette and approved by the IB. The textbook fully addresses both SL and HL content, caters to either Python or Java as the language of instruction, and includes a thorough 40 page guide to the IA filled with exemplar work from former students, top tips, common mistakes, and checklists.

The authors delivered a webinar to launch the new book and outline key features, which is available here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0SKH9EMXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0SKH9EMXM)
